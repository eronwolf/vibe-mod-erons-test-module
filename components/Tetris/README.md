# Tetris Game Implementation

A classic Tetris game implemented using React, TypeScript, and HTML5 Canvas.

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay with all seven standard tetromino pieces
- Piece movement (left, right, down) and rotation
- Hard drop functionality for quick piece placement
- Line clearing with scoring system
- Increasing difficulty as the player progresses
- Game state management (start, pause, game over)
- Sound effects for various game actions
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes

## Game Controls

- **Left/Right Arrow Keys**: Move the current piece left or right
- **Down Arrow Key**: Soft drop (move the piece down faster)
- **Up Arrow Key**: Rotate the piece clockwise
- **Spacebar**: Hard drop (instantly drop the piece to the bottom)
- **P Key**: Pause/resume the game

## Implementation Details

The game is structured with the following components:

### Core Game Engine

- `constants.ts`: Game constants like board dimensions, speeds, and scoring
- `tetrominos.ts`: Tetromino definitions and rotation logic
- `board.ts`: Game board logic, collision detection, and line clearing
- `gameState.ts`: Game state management and game mechanics

### React Components

- `TetrisGame.tsx`: Main game component that integrates all parts
- `TetrisCanvas.tsx`: Canvas rendering component for the game board

### Hooks

- `useGameLoop.ts`: Game loop for automatic piece movement
- `useKeyboardControls.ts`: Keyboard input handling
- `useSoundEffects.ts`: Sound effect management

### Utilities

- `canvas.ts`: Canvas drawing utilities
- `soundManager.ts`: Sound effect management

## Testing Across Browsers

To ensure the game works correctly across different browsers, test it in:

1. **Chrome/Edge**: Test the game in Chromium-based browsers
2. **Firefox**: Verify canvas rendering and keyboard controls
3. **Safari**: Check for any WebKit-specific issues
4. **Mobile browsers**: Test touch controls and responsive layout

### Common Issues to Watch For

- Canvas rendering differences between browsers
- Keyboard event handling variations
- Audio playback restrictions (some browsers block autoplay)
- Performance differences, especially on mobile devices

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the game:

- Add touch/swipe controls for mobile devices
- Implement a high score system with local storage
- Add additional game modes (e.g., marathon, sprint, ultra)
- Improve visual effects and animations
- Add multiplayer capabilities
