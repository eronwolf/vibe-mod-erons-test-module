# Tetris Game Sound Effects

This directory is where sound effect files for the Tetris game should be placed.

In a real implementation, you would add the following sound files:

- `move.mp3` - Sound when moving a piece left or right
- `rotate.mp3` - Sound when rotating a piece
- `drop.mp3` - Sound when hard dropping a piece
- `clear.mp3` - Sound when clearing lines
- `levelup.mp3` - Sound when leveling up
- `gameover.mp3` - Sound when the game ends

For development purposes, you can use placeholder sound files or obtain free sound effects from resources like:
- [Freesound](https://freesound.org/)
- [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/)
- [ZapSplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)

Make sure to respect licensing terms when using sound effects from these or other sources.
